After completing this project, I learned how to apply design thinking to solve real-world problems in a structured and user-centered way. I gained a better understanding of how user needs are identified through surveys and observations, and how these needs guide system design and feature development.

I also gained experience in teamwork, communication, and prototype development. This project helped me connect theoretical knowledge with practical application and improved my problem-solving skills, preparing me for future academic projects and industry work.
